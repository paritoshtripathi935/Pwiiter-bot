# why NFT
We are currently living in a world, where there is a massive explosion of digital assets - hundreds of blockchains, thousands of metaverses, tens of thousands of NFT collections, and millions of NFTs. Also, this number is growing rapidly day by day. So there is a dire need to identify the new and trending NFT collections across different blockchains to keep up with the latest happenings. Social media plays a crucial role in todayâ€™s NFT world. Collectors flaunt their NFT arts on social media platforms which become viral soon. So the aim of this challenge is to identify those collections early using these social media signals.

# Problem Statement
Identify the trending NFT collections on Twitter using Twitter data on a daily basis and analyze their sentiments.
 

# Dataset:

Get the tweets from Twitter using the hashtags given below for the last 7 to 14 days (or more if possible) and identify the trending NFT collections on a daily basis and analyze the sentiments of these tweets.

Hashtags: #nfts #nft #nftart #nftcommunity #nftcollector #NFTs #NFT #NFTCommunity #NFTcommunity #nftgiveaway #NFTGiveaway #metaverse #web3 #NFTCollection #NFTGame #NFTdrop #NFTartists #NFTProject #NFTMarketplace #NFTdrops (add more as applicable).

 

A typical day in the life of a Data Scientist (including here at bitsCrunch) involves spending a lot of time extracting and aggregating data from different sources, preprocessing the data, munging the data so as to build better models. So we wish to give the feel of working in a real-time problem rather than just another off-the-shelf hackathon by providing some predefined data - as we are also looking at this as an opportunity to hire rockstar people to our team.

 

Getting Started: Some heads-up on the ways to extract twitter data from Twitter using the open-source libraries below :

Twint (https://pypi.org/project/twint/)

Tweepy (https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/)

Feel free to use any other open-source framework/tools to extract the tweets and also to get the sentiments.
